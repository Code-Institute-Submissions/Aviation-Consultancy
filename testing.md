#### Unsolved Bugs ####

[Issue #60](https://github.com/simonjvardy/Aviation-Consultancy/issues/60)
- Unit Testing: Homepage callout image doesnâ€™t resize on an iPad or iPhone display
  - CSS property `background-attachment: fixed;` is not recognised by Apple devices and causes the website hero images using this property to display incorrectly
  - The workaround is to set the property back to the default `background-attachment: scroll;` but this will affect all devices and remove the image effect I was aiming for.
  - An alternative solution, without resorting to JavaScript, is to add devices screen size specific `@media` queries to style.css to change from fixed to scroll but this can become difficult and messy.
    - This has been tested within the current [style.css](https://github.com/simonjvardy/Aviation-Consultancy/blob/master/assets/css/style.css) file for a specific iPhone model screen size and can be seen at the end of the file.
  - A more elegant solution to this problem by using only HTML & CSS is ongoing.
