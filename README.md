# ![Logo](/wireframes/) #

***Aviation Consultancy LLC** is (fictitious) consultancy business specialising in aircraft maintenance data and regulatory compliance, based at 
London Heathrow Airport.
I designed the website to be a showcase of the available services and a means for new customers to make contact with the business allowing project and service requests to be submitted. 
It's not required to sell any products directly but describes the company values, unique selling points and the problems the company can solve for its clients.*

*I created the Aviation Consultancy LLC logo to present a professional, trustworthy image based on research of similar contemporary consultancy service websites 
(details of these websites can be found in the Credits section). The colour scheme was chosen from the Blue / Green colours to reflect a calm balanced approach as well as to 
blend well with the aviation and sky themes.*

## Design Choices ##

### Topology ###


### Fonts ###

We have chosen [Oswald](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Oswald?query=Oswald) for all of the headers and [Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto?query=Roboto) the rest of the text.

### Colours ###

We have chosen the colour that say ... appealing to the eye and also compliments the design of the project.
![Colour palette](wireframes/Palette.png)

- *Grullo* (AF9483) - Light soft brown
- *Umber* (615550) - Dark brown
- *Alabaster* (F0EDE5) - Off white

These colours will compliment each other well when used across the site creating pleasant ambience.

### Wireframes ###

We designed our site mock-ups using [balsamiq wireframes](https://balsamiq.com/). We were focusing on defining basic layout structure of the site and identifying how displays would change on different screen sizes such as [mobile](/wireframes/mobile.jpg), [tablet](/wireframes/tablet.jpg) and [desktop](/wireframes/desktop.jpg).

## Version Control ##
**Version control** for this repository is managed within **GitHub** and **Gitpod** using separate [branches](https://github.com/simonjvardy/MS-1/branches)  used to work on specific aspects of the project.
The following describes the repository branch structure:
- **Master** - this is the default branch and the source for the repository deployment.
    - **Documentation** - this branch is used for updating the README.md and testing.md documentation only.
	- **Development** - this branch is used as the main working branch for the website development
	- Each individual **bug fixes** are raised within their own **separate branches** using the naming convention **\<GitHub Issue ID Number>-\<bug fix description>** e.g. branch name ***12-correct-navbar-links*** 

The following worflow steps are used to create and update branches within Gitpod and to push changes back to GitHub.
1. Open **Gitpod** from **Github** using the Gitpod button. This needs to only be done **once** at the start of the project.
2. Start the Gitpod Workspace which opens an **online IDE editor** window.
3. For changes to be made to any **documentation files**, the git command `git checkout documentation` is used to checkout and switch to the **documentation branch**.
4. For changes to be made to **all other files**, the git command `git checkout development` is used to checkout and switch to the **development branch**.
5. **New** or **modified** files are **staged** using the `git add .` command
6. The changes are **committed** using `git commit -m "<commit message>"` command.
7. The **committed** changes are **pushed** from Gitpod to GitHub using the `git push` command.
8. Opening the repository in Github,  a new **pull request** is created for the updated branch and assigned to the **Development project**.
9. The changes are **reviewed** to ensure there are **no conflicts** between the **updated branch** and the **Master branch**.
10. The changes are then **merged** into the **Master branch** and the merge request is **closed**. The **Project entry** is **automatically** moved to the **Done** card.
11. To update Gitpod with the **latest commits** From GitHub, the `git checkout master` command is used to checkout and switch to the master branch.
12. Use the `git pull` command to update the master branch and **reset the pointer**.
13. Now **switch** to the **other branches** in Gitpod and use the `git merge origin/master` command to **update each branch in turn**.
14. Use the `git push` on **each branch** to update the relevant GiHub Branches to the **same commit** as the **Master branch**.
15. **Repeat steps 3 - 14 regularly** to ensure updates are **saved** and **correctly version controlled** in GitHub.

## Project Management ##

GitHub [Projects](https://github.com/simonjvardy/MS-1/projects/1) are used to organise the planning and development of the website using the Automated kanban template.
The following project cards are used to manage the tasks:
- **Backlog** - this card is used to capture ideas for project tasks.
- **To Do** - this is the current work queue for the project.
- **In Progress** - this is the list of tasks currently in work.
    - New issues and pull requests are automatically added to this column using project card automation options.
- **Review in progress** - Pull requests are automatically moved here by project automation options when the reviewer requests any changes to be carried out.
    - As there is only one contributor on this project currently, most pull requests bypass this card as the request is usually reviewed and merged in the same step.
- **Reviewer approved** - Pull requests are automatically moved here by project automation options when they meet the minimum number of required reviews.
    - As there is only one contributor currently, most pull requests bypass this card as the request is usually reviewed and merged in the same step.
- **Testing** - Testing tasks list
- **Done** - completed tasks

Markdown syntax is used to create checkboxes by adding `- [ ]` and `- [x]` text which creates a **"to do" list** on cards as a way of spliting a single complex task into a list of steps to be completed.

## Testing ##

- Testing information can be found in a separate [testing.md](testing.md) file.

---
## Bugs ##

To manage bugs and issues tracking, the default GitHub [bug_report.md template](https://github.com/simonjvardy/MS-1/blob/master/.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md) has been created and activated within the repository settings Features > Issues section.
All new bugs and issues are tracked within the GitHub repository [Issues section](https://github.com/simonjvardy/MS-1/issues) .
Open issues are managed within the [GitHub Projects section](https://github.com/simonjvardy/MS-1/projects/1)

Each branch is then **merged** into the **master branch** using a **pull request** that is **linked** to the **open issue**. Once merged, and the bug report **closed**, the branch is **deleted**.

FIxed bugs and issues are marked as [closed](https://github.com/simonjvardy/MS-1/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed).
